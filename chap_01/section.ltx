\documentclass[12pt]{article}

% We have defined this document to a 12pt article format.
% Blank lines mean nothing here, in the Preamble...

\begin{document} % Begin document "environment"

\section{This is a section}
\subsection{This is a subsection}
This is the body of the subsection.
I can move to a new line anytime, and I can put in     lots
of    blanks    with           no              effect.




Skipping 4-5 lines is the same as skipping 1 line ---
it simply starts a new paragraph.

\subsection{Here is another subsection}
\section{Here is another section}
\end{document}
