\section{Paragraphs Demo...! :-)}

\begin{center}
  This text is centered because I am in the centered environment.
  Text remains centered as long as we are inside this environment.
\end{center}
\begin{flushleft}
  Now we are out of the centering environment and in the flushleft environment.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushright}
  Now we are in the flushright environment.
  You will have occasion to use all 4 paragraph environments.
\end{flushright}

I am back to the default normal justification. The added space we see between the
above paragraphs is due to entering those different environments.
